# pi-fusion

Multi-model deliberation for [pi](https://pi.dev/), inspired by [OpenRouter Fusion](https://openrouter.ai/blog/announcements/fusion-beats-frontier/).

pi-fusion sends your prompt to several of the models you're already authed for, then has a judge model compare their answers. The judge's analysis (where the models agree, disagree, or each missed something) goes back to your active model, which writes the final answer. It needs no configuration to start.

## When it helps

Running several models is slower and costs more tokens than one, so it's worth it when a second or third opinion changes the outcome: research, architecture trade-offs, critiques, and decisions that are expensive to get wrong. For routine edits it adds little. By default fusion only runs when the active model judges a task worth it, so most prompts are unaffected.

What you get from a panel that you don't from one model:

- Agreement across independent models is a stronger signal than one model's confidence.
- Disagreement is reported per model rather than averaged away, so you can see what's actually contested.
- A single model has consistent blind spots. Models from different providers tend not to share them, so the panel covers points any one model misses.

## What it does

When the `fusion` tool runs, pi:

1. Picks a panel of authed models (a diverse auto-selection by default, or your configured panel).
2. Sends your prompt to every panel model in parallel.
3. Sends all panel responses to a judge model, which returns structured analysis:
   - **consensus**: points most models agree on (treat as higher-confidence)
   - **contradictions**: where models disagree, with each model's stance
   - **partial_coverage**: points only some models raised
   - **unique_insights**: ideas raised by a single model
   - **blind_spots**: topics no panel model addressed
4. Your active model receives the analysis plus the raw responses and writes the final answer.

When two or more panel models answer, the judge synthesis runs. If only one model succeeds, the single response is returned directly (no synthesis).

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-fusion                            # from npm
pi install git:github.com/synthetic-recon/pi-fusion # from GitHub
pi install /path/to/pi-fusion                       # from a local checkout
```

After installing or updating in a running session, run `/reload`.

There's no build step; pi loads the TypeScript directly via [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti). Requires Node ≥ 22.19.0.

## Quick start

```
# 1. (optional) pick your panel and judge interactively
/fusion-setup

# 2. just ask; the model decides when fusion is worth it (this is the default)
Use fusion to compare REST vs GraphQL for a new public API.

# 3. or force every prompt through fusion for the session
/fusion on
```

Check what's active any time with `/fusion-status`.

No setup is required: with no panel configured, fusion auto-selects a diverse set of your authed models, and the default mode is `available` (the model calls fusion when a task benefits from it).

## Usage

### As a tool

By default fusion is `available`, so the model can call it whenever a task genuinely benefits from multiple perspectives. Just ask:

```
Use fusion to evaluate whether we should migrate to the Next.js App Router.
```

### Session modes

```
/fusion on        # force every prompt through fusion (alias: forced); needs a panel from /fusion-setup
/fusion available # enable fusion; the model decides when to use it (alias: auto)
/fusion off       # disable fusion and block fusion tool calls for the session (alias: disable)
/fusion           # no argument: toggle between available and forced
```

Typing `/fusion ` offers `on` / `available` / `off` as argument completions. Mode is saved in the session and restored on `/resume`.

### Force fusion for one prompt

Run a single prompt through fusion without changing the session mode:

```
/fusion <prompt>
```

The active model calls fusion, then writes the final answer itself in its normal voice.

### Adding conversation context

**All fusion config is yours** — panel, judge, tool access, max tool calls, temperature, and token budgets are set via `/fusion-setup` (session) or `fusion.json`, and the model invoking the tool cannot pick or override any of them. It only supplies the prompt (and may choose whether to include recent conversation context).

Panel and judge calls do **not** see the whole pi conversation thread. When prior context matters, either put the relevant details in the prompt, or ask fusion to include recent turns:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Evaluate the architecture decision we just discussed.",
  "context_mode": "recent",
  "context_turns": 6
}
```

`context_mode` defaults to `"none"`. `context_turns` is clamped to 1–10 (default 4). The judge sees the same context-expanded task the panel saw, plus the panel responses.

## Configuration

Configuration is optional. To pin a panel and judge, create either:

- `~/.pi/agent/fusion.json` (global)
- `<cwd>/.pi/fusion.json` (project-local, overrides global; loaded only for trusted projects)

Generate a project-local template with `/fusion-init`, or write one by hand:

```json
{
  "panel": [
    "openai/gpt-5.5",
    "z-ai/glm-5.2",
    "moonshotai/kimi-2.7"
  ],
  "judge": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-8",
  "maxPanelModels": 3,
  "maxPanelOutputTokens": 2048,
  "maxCompletionTokens": 4096,
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "panelTools": "none",
  "maxToolCalls": 16,
  "footerDisplay": "full"
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `panel` | auto-diverse | Model identifiers in `provider/id` form. Only authed models are used. |
| `judge` | current model, then first panel model | Model identifier in `provider/id` form. |
| `maxPanelModels` | 3 | Max panel size (1–8). |
| `maxPanelOutputTokens` | 2048 | Max tokens per panel response. |
| `maxCompletionTokens` | 4096 | Max tokens for the judge analysis. |
| `temperature` | 0.3 | Sampling temperature for panel and judge calls. |
| `panelTools` | `"none"` | Panel tool access: `"none"`, `"readonly"` (read/grep/find/ls), `"all"` (adds bash/edit/write), or an explicit tool-name list (e.g. `["read", "grep"]`). The list form is **config-file only**. |
| `maxToolCalls` | 16 | Max tool-call steps **per panel model** when tools are on (1–100). Models batch several calls per turn, so this is the per-agent budget; total ≈ panel size × this. |
| `panelToolsConsent` | `false` | Pre-authorize mutating tools in non-interactive (`-p`) runs. |
| `footerDisplay` | `"full"` | Footer verbosity: `"full"` keeps the current mode/panel/judge/tools text, `"compact"` shows only mode + panel count, and `"off"` hides pi-fusion's footer text. |

**Precedence.** Everything resolves session selection (`/fusion-setup`) → `fusion.json` → defaults/auto-selection. The invoking model can't override any of it (the tool takes only the prompt + optional context controls).

**How models are resolved.** Reference models as `provider/id` (e.g. `openai/gpt-5.5`); a bare `id` matches by exact id across providers. Only authed models are used; a configured model that isn't authed is skipped with a warning. With no panel configured, fusion auto-selects a diverse set spread across providers. The judge defaults to your current model, falling back to the first panel model.

### Panel tools (multi-turn)

By default panel models answer in a single turn with no tools. Enable tools to let each panel model **gather evidence before answering** (read files, grep, search) across multiple internal turns (bounded by `maxToolCalls`), then return its answer. The judge stays tool-free.

- **`readonly`** (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`): safe; no mutation.
- **`all`**: adds `bash`, `edit`, `write`. **Off by default** and requires consent (the `/fusion-setup` picker prompts; non-interactive runs need `"panelToolsConsent": true`). Because several models run concurrently, mutating runs **serialize the panel** so they can't clobber each other's writes. Without consent, `all` downgrades to read-only.

Set tools and footer display in `/fusion-setup` (Config section) or in `fusion.json` (`panelTools`, `maxToolCalls`, `footerDisplay`). These are user configuration only — the invoking model has no tool parameters to override them.

> **Note:** enabling panel tools means **file contents (and command output for `all`) are sent to every panel model's provider**. Only enable it where that's acceptable.

## FAQ

**Does fusion run on every prompt?**

No. By default the mode is `available`, so the active model only calls fusion when a task benefits from multiple perspectives. Routine prompts are untouched. Use `/fusion on` to force it on every prompt, or `/fusion off` to disable it for the session.

**Does it cost more tokens / money?**

Yes, when it runs. Each panel model is a separate completion, plus one judge call. This is why it's opt-in per task by default. Tune cost with `maxPanelModels`, `maxPanelOutputTokens`, and `maxCompletionTokens`.

**Is my code or prompt sent to other providers?**

The prompt goes to every panel model and the judge, all models you're already authed for. With **panel tools** enabled, file contents (and command output, for `all`) are also sent to every panel model's provider. Tools are off by default; only enable them where that data sharing is acceptable.

**Why didn't fusion run when I asked?**

In `available` mode the model decides. If you want a guaranteed run, use `/fusion <prompt>` for one prompt or `/fusion on` for the session. Forced mode also needs at least one usable panel model, so check `/fusion-status`.

**Why did I get one model's answer with no analysis?**

The judge synthesis only runs when **two or more** panel models succeed. If a single model answers (others failed or weren't authed), its response is returned directly.

**Which models get picked, and why was one skipped?**

Only authed models are used. With no configured panel, fusion auto-selects a diverse set across providers. A configured model that isn't authed is skipped with a warning. See **How models are resolved** above, or run `/fusion-status` to see the active panel and judge.

**Does it work in non-interactive (`-p`) runs?**

Yes. `/fusion-setup` is interactive-only, so configure the panel/judge via `fusion.json` instead. To allow mutating panel tools without an interactive prompt, set `"panelToolsConsent": true`.

**How do I see what the panel and judge actually said?**

`/fusion-report <prompt>` runs fusion directly and writes the raw panel/judge diagnostic report into the editor.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/fusion-setup` | Choose the panel, judge, panel tools, and footer display in an interactive picker (interactive mode only). |
| `/fusion on` \| `available` \| `off` | Set the session mode (aliases: `forced`, `auto`, `disable`). |
| `/fusion` | With no argument, toggle between `available` and `forced`. |
| `/fusion <prompt>` | Force fusion for a single prompt, then answer normally. |
| `/fusion-status` | Show the current mode, panel, and judge. |
| `/fusion-report <prompt>` | Run fusion directly and write the raw panel/judge diagnostic report into the editor. |
| `/fusion-init` | Write a `.pi/fusion.json` template (confirms before overwriting; trusted projects only). |

### `/fusion-setup` controls

Two sections, **Models** and **Config**, with the live panel/judge selection shown at the top. **Tab** switches sections; **Enter** saves, **Esc** cancels.

- **Models:** `↑/↓` move · `p` toggle panel · `j` toggle judge (independent of the panel; can be any model or left unset for auto) · `c` clear panel · `/` search.
- **Config:** `↑/↓` move · `Space` / `←→` change a value. Settings: **Panel tools** (`none` → `readonly` → `all`), **Max tool calls** (`4`/`8`/`12`/`16`/`25`/`50`/`100`), and **Footer** (`full` → `compact` → `off`).

Selections (panel, judge, mode) are saved in the session and restored on `/resume`.

## Development

```bash
npm install    # installs peer deps for type-checking and tests
npm run check  # tsc --noEmit
npm test       # runs every suite in src/__tests__/
npm pack --dry-run
```

There's no build step. Try the extension live with `pi -e .`, then `/reload` after edits.

## Differences from OpenRouter Fusion

- Uses pi's authed models instead of OpenRouter's catalog.
- Does not inject `openrouter:web_search` or `openrouter:web_fetch` into panel/judge calls (pi has its own tools; the outer model can still use them).
- No recursion-depth header is needed; inner calls use `complete()` directly and never see the `fusion` tool.
- Adds interactive panel/judge selection via `/fusion-setup`.
- Adds session modes (`available`, `forced`, `off`), diagnostic reports (`/fusion-report`), and session-state persistence.
